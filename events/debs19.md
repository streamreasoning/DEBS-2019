## Presenters

*Riccardo Tommasini* is a Ph.D. student at the Department of Electronics and Information of the Politecnico di Milano since 2015. His research interests span Stream Processing, Semantic Technologies, Description Logics, Programming Languages, and Benchmarking. His ongoing PhD thesis investigate the Velocity aspects of the Web of Data. Riccardo’s tutorial activities comprise Big Data Tutorial at Kno.e.sis Center Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio (2015), Stream Reasoning Tutorial at ISWC 2017, ICWE 2018, ESWC 2019, and TheWebConf 2019.

*Sherif Sakr* is the Head of Data Systems Group at the Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Estonia. He received his PhD degree in Computer and Information Science from Konstanz University, Germany in 2007. Sherif is an ACM Senior Member and an IEEE Senior Member. In 2017, he has been appointed to serve as an ACM Distinguished Speaker and as an IEEE Distinguished Speaker. He is currently serving as the Editor-in-Chief of the Springer Encyclopedia of Big Data Technologies. Prof. Sakr’s research interest is data and information management in general, particularly in big data processing systems, big data analytics and data science. Prof. Sakr has published more than 100 refereed research publications in international journals and conferences such as: Proceedings of the VLDB endowment (PVLDB), IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (IEEE TPDS), IEEE Transactions on Service Computing (IEEE TSC), IEEE Transactions on Big Data (IEEE TBD), ACM Computing Survey (ACM CSUR), SIGMOD, ICDE and EDBT. He delivered several tutorial in various conferences including WWW’12, IC2E’14, CAiSE’14 and EDBT Summer School 2015. The 2nd ScaDS International Summer School on Big Data 2016, The 3rd Keystone Training School on Keyword search in Big Linked Data 2017 and ISWC 2019. More information is available here.

## Organizers

*Marco Balduini* earned his doctorate in 2019 from Politecnico di Milano and he is actually a post-doc at the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria (DEIB). His research work focuses on Big Data, Data Processing, Semantic technologies, Data Science and Data integration. His major interest is the management of heterogeneous stream of spatio-temporal data characterized by high volumes. He contributed in Stream Reasoning research field and his work was applied in analyzing heterogeneous data streams from Social Media, Mobile Telecommunication and IoT in collaboration with Telecom Italia and Siemens. He was actively involved in the development of the C-SPARQL Engine, in the W3C Community Group on RDF Stream Processing (RSP) and in the organization of Stream Reasoning tutorials ISWC 2013, ISWC 2014, ISWC 2015 and ISWC 2016. He participated in the research activities of the EU FP7 projects LarKC and ModaClouds and in the EIT projects City Data Fusion for Event Management, Crowd Insights, and Welcome. He is also a cofounder of Fluxedo, a start-up that exploits cutting-edge technology in the field of big data management and analysis.

*Emanuele Della Valle* is an Assistant Professor of Software Project Management at the Department of Electronics and Information of the Politecnico di Milano. In more than 15 years of research, his research interests covered Big Data, Stream Processing, Semantic technologies, Data Science, Web Information Retrieval, and Service Oriented Architectures. He branded the stream reasoning research field. The semantic and syntactic extensions, which he proposed to the SemanticWeb stack (i.e., RDF streams and Continuous SPARQL), are currently on the path towards standardization at a W3C in the RDF Stream Processing community group. His work on Stream Reasoning was applied in analyzing Social Media, Mobile Telecom and IoT data streams in collaboration with Telecom Italia, IBM, Siemens, Oracle, Indra, and Statoil. In 2015, he started up a company (Fluxedo) to commercialize the open source results of Stream Reasoning research. His education activities include lecturing on Web Science, Software Project Management, Semantic Technologies, Stream Processing and Big Data technologies.
