## Abstract
The Big Data movement proposes data streaming systems to tame velocity and to enable reactive decision making. 
However, approaching such systems is still too complex due to the paradigm shift they require, i.e., 
moving from scalable batch processing to continuous data analysis and pattern detection. 
Recently, declarative Languages are playing a crucial role in fostering the adoption of Stream Processing solutions. 
In particular, several key players introduce SQL extensions for stream processing. 
These new languages are currently playing a central role in fostering the stream processing paradigm shift. 
In this tutorial, we give an overview of the various languages for declarative querying interfaces big streaming data. 
To this extent, we discuss how the different Big Stream Processing Engines (BigSPE) interpret, execute, 
and optimize continuous queries expressed with SQL-like languages such as KSQL, Flink-SQL, and Spark SQL. 
Finally, we present the open research challenges in the domain.
